The block parameter in the code on lines `1` and `3` is `n`.

On line `1` the block calls the `+` method on the object that `n` is referencing and passes in the integer `1` as argument. 

On line 3, on the other hand, the block reassigns variable `n` to the return value of method call `+` on the object that `n` is referencing and passes in the integer `1` as argument. `n += 1` is Ruby's syntactical sugar for `n.+(1)`.

The block's return value is the same but in the code on line `3` we make an extra assignment. The first expression `n + 1` is therefore more efficient because we do not assign the value again to `n`. 

The second expression `n +=1` could be useful if we need to make other operations with `n` inside of the block.

In either way, the `map` methods return `[2, 3, 4]`.
